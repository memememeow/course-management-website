Valid credentials are user and admin. In phase1, whichever credential you use to login, we assume that you have logged in as ¡°admin¡± who has not yet chosen any courses yet. Therefore, after passing login, the timetable and the list of courses on left will be blank.

1. Login View
In the login view, we check a user¡¯s credential by username and password. If you check the ¡°Show Password¡±, the password you input will be showed so that you can see whether you input the correct password. Here, we assume that the two acceptable user names are ¡°user¡± and ¡°admin¡±, whose passwords are ¡°user¡± and ¡°admin¡± respectively. After inputting correct user name and password, click login and then you can shift to the timetable view. If you click the register button, the view will shift to the registration view.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Registration View
In the registration view, a user has to fill up the form provided to create a new account. Among all the fields, user must fill up the required area which is mentioned in the page. 
Here are some restrictions for the input from user:
	i. Email should be in the form of ¡°{sth}@{sth}.{sth}¡± where ¡®sth¡¯ can be any integers or letters with no space inside.
	ii. Password and Password(retype) should have the same value and none of them should be empty.
	iii. Year should be integers only.
	iv. Users can choose as many programs as they like from the provided list of programs by clicking the add button. Note the programs will be 	stored in database instead of being hardcoded in phase2. Any duplicate choices will only be considered as 1 choice (no duplicate programs are 	added to the user object)
	v. Age must be an integer
After clicking the submit button, if all the fields have valid values, there will be a pop up window which means that a new user has been successfully created and the view will be changed back to the index view. If there is any error in the user input, there will be a pop up window telling the user which input from them is invalid. 
Note that there is no user being created and stored in the server.

3. Timetable View
In the data.js, we hardcoded 9  courses and 4 users. To find out the courses, you can use the ¡°Search Course¡± bar in the timetable view. We assume that all course codes only contain upper-case letters. However, if your input contains lower-case letters, we can still view them as upper-case letters and find out the corresponding course codes.  As you input characters in ¡°Search Course¡± bar, all courses whose code starts with the current input will be listed in the dropdown menu. For each course in the dropdown menu, you can find two buttons called ¡°Add¡± and ¡°Remove¡±.

When you click the add button, the course will be added to the course list and sections of this course will appear on the timetable. If conflict exists between the new course and previously selected course, an alert message will jump out to tell the user which courses conflict. In the timetable, different courses will be assigned different colors. Beside the title of each timetable, you can see the total workload of each semester. In phase 1, we assume that each course has a credit of 0.5.

In the course list on left, you can see a list of courses which have already been added. On right of each course code, you can find a ¡°remove¡± button which you click to remove the corresponding course from the course list and the timetable. If you click on the list item without touching the remove button, view will shift to the course info view. Since data is hardcoded, we only show the info about CSC108F. 

Furthermore, by clicking the icon on right top of the page, you can get a dropdown menu containing three links which are ¡°View profile¡±, ¡°Edit password¡± and ¡°Edit profile¡±. If you want to close this dropdown menu, click the icon again. In the dropdown menu, by clicking ¡°View profile¡±, you can shift to the profile view which shows information about the current user. (In phase 1, this user is hard coded as ¡°admin¡±.)  By clicking the ¡°Edit password¡±, you can shift to a view in which you input the new password and retype it to confirm. After submitting the new password, you can see an alert which tells you the user¡¯s name and shows you the new password.  By clicking the ¡°Edit profile¡± view, you can shift to the view in which you can input new profile info.
